Hey, I cannot understand you code. It takes a long time for me to understand your logic
Like i previously said 
1) Break it into even small function. 
2) Make sure you comment your code.
3) Avoid variables like RES.(result i believe)
4) Avoid these one liners if(al.get(right)>=maxright) maxright= al.get(right);
5) make sure for ever if condition there is a bracket. 
// All these will help improve your coding style and make sure the next developer can understand your code.
// And also shows you have coding experience.
