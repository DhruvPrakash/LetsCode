Hint:
Create a new stack
This new stack holds the minimum values.
When the value is being pushed, if it is a min value, it gets pushed into the new stack
Else it wont as to remove the minimum value the values above it needs to be removed before reaching it.
When being popped if the value is a min value then pop in our new stack.
min function would peek the top of our new stack.
