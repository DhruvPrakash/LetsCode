I solved this ... But i was breaking my head as i made a mistake.
Logic was pakka everything but didnt solve all test cases/
Why?
public HashMap<Character,Node> node= new HashMap<>();
instead of the above i used
public static HashMap<Character,Node> node= new HashMap<>();
Can someone please explain why that static keyword made such a huge diffrence
